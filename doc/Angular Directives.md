# Angular Directives
List of basic implementations of Angular directives, including structural directives and others, along with a short introduction for each:

1. NgIf:
   - The NgIf directive conditionally adds or removes elements from the DOM based on the provided expression.

2. NgFor:
   - The NgFor directive repeats a template for each item in an iterable collection, allowing dynamic rendering of lists or tables.

3. NgSwitch:
   - The NgSwitch directive conditionally renders content based on multiple expressions using a switch-case-like syntax.

4. NgClass:
   - The NgClass directive dynamically adds or removes CSS classes based on provided conditions or expressions.

5. NgStyle:
   - The NgStyle directive allows dynamic manipulation of HTML element styles by binding to an object or expression that defines the styles.

6. NgModel:
   - The NgModel directive provides two-way data binding between a form input element and a component property, enabling easy handling of user input.

7. NgSubmit:
   - The NgSubmit directive captures and handles the form submission event when used within a form element.

8. NgSwitchCase:
   - The NgSwitchCase directive represents a case block within an NgSwitch directive, matching a particular value and rendering content accordingly.

9. NgSwitchDefault:
   - The NgSwitchDefault directive represents a default case block within an NgSwitch directive, rendering content when none of the NgSwitchCase conditions match.

10. NgTemplateOutlet:
    - The NgTemplateOutlet directive renders a template at a specific location in the component's view, allowing reusability and dynamic rendering of templates.

11. NgContent:
    - The NgContent directive allows content projection and enables the insertion of external content into a component's template.

12. NgClassEven and NgClassOdd:
    - The NgClassEven and NgClassOdd directives apply CSS classes to elements in a collection based on their odd or even index values.

13. NgPlural and NgPluralCase:
    - The NgPlural and NgPluralCase directives provide pluralization support by conditionally rendering content based on numeric values.

14. NgStyle:
    - The NgStyle directive allows dynamic manipulation of HTML element styles by binding to an object or expression that defines the styles.

15. NgNonBindable:
    - The NgNonBindable directive prevents Angular from processing and binding to the content within its boundaries, useful when you want to display Angular-specific syntax as plain text.

These directives play a significant role in building dynamic and interactive Angular applications by providing powerful tools for manipulating the DOM, iterating over collections, conditionally rendering content, and applying dynamic styles.
