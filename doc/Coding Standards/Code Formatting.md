6. Code Formatting:
   - Consistent code formatting enhances code readability and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

   - Follow a consistent indentation style, such as using two spaces or four spaces for indentation. Choose a style that aligns with your team's or organization's conventions.

   - Use a linter, such as ESLint or TSLint, to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues. Linters can be configured with rules for code formatting, style conventions, and best practices.

   - Here's an example of consistent code formatting:

     ```typescript
     import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
     import { UserService } from './user.service';

     @Component({
       selector: 'app-user',
       templateUrl: './user.component.html',
       styleUrls: ['./user.component.css']
     })
     export class UserComponent implements OnInit {
       constructor(private userService: UserService) { }

       ngOnInit(): void {
         this.userService.getUserList()
           .subscribe(users => {
             this.users = users;
           }, error => {
             console.error(error);
           });
       }

       // ...
     }
     ```

     In this example, consistent indentation with two spaces is used, and the code is formatted to improve readability.

   - Integrating a code formatter, such as Prettier, in your development workflow can help automatically format your code according to predefined rules, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

Adhering to consistent code formatting practices and utilizing linters or code formatters can significantly improve the quality and maintainability of your Angular code.
