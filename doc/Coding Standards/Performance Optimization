10. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimizing the performance of your Angular application is crucial for delivering a fast and responsive user experience.

   - Use Angular's Change Detection strategy wisely. By default, Angular uses the OnPush change detection strategy, which triggers change detection only when inputs to a component change or when an event occurs. This strategy can significantly improve performance by reducing unnecessary change detection cycles.

   - Leverage lazy loading to load modules and components on-demand. Lazy loading helps improve initial page load time by deferring the loading of non-critical components until they are needed.

   - Minimize the use of two-way data binding (`[(ngModel)]`) as it triggers change detection on each keystroke. Instead, prefer one-way data binding (`[property]` or `(event)`) when possible.

   - Optimize the rendering performance by using trackBy with ngFor. The trackBy function allows Angular to track and re-use elements efficiently when the underlying collection changes.

   - Avoid expensive operations in the template, such as complex calculations or filtering of large data sets. Perform these operations in the component class instead and bind the results to the template.

   **Common mistakes to avoid:**

   - Overusing ngIf and ngSwitch: Excessive use of structural directives like ngIf and ngSwitch can result in unnecessary DOM manipulations. Use them judiciously and consider alternative approaches when appropriate.

   - Inefficient data retrieval: Avoid making redundant or inefficient API calls. Optimize data retrieval by caching, pagination, or utilizing server-side filtering and sorting.

   - Lack of performance profiling: Regularly profile your application's performance using tools like Chrome DevTools or Angular's built-in performance profiling tools. Identify and address performance bottlenecks to improve overall performance.

   By implementing performance optimization techniques and being mindful of potential pitfalls, you can create high-performing Angular applications.
