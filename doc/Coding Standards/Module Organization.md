4. Module Organization:
   - Grouping related functionality into feature modules helps to organize and modularize your Angular application.

   - Create feature modules for different sections or features of your application. For example, you could have a `UserModule` for user-related functionality and an `AdminModule` for administrative features.

   - Separate core functionality into a core module. The core module can contain services, interceptors, and other essential elements that are shared throughout the application.

   - Utilize shared modules for components, directives, and pipes that are reused across multiple feature modules. Shared modules help avoid code duplication and make it easier to manage and update shared components.

Here's an example of module organization:

```typescript
// user.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

import { UserListComponent } from './user-list/user-list.component';
import { UserDetailComponent } from './user-detail/user-detail.component';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    UserListComponent,
    UserDetailComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  providers: [
    UserService
  ]
})
export class UserModule { }
```

In this example, the `UserModule` is created to encapsulate the user-related functionality. It imports `CommonModule` for common Angular directives and exports the `UserListComponent` and `UserDetailComponent` to be used in other modules. The `UserService` is provided at the module level, making it available throughout the module.

By organizing your application into feature modules, core modules, and shared modules, you can promote reusability, separation of concerns, and maintainability in your Angular codebase.
