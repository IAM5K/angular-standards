11. Security and Secure Coding:
   - Security should be a top priority when developing Angular applications to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.

   Authentication and Authorization:
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive functionality and data. Use industry-standard authentication protocols like OAuth or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and enforce authorization checks on server-side APIs.

   ```typescript
   // Example of using JWT authentication in Angular
   import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';

   // ...

   const headers = new HttpHeaders().set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
   this.http.get('/api/secure-data', { headers }).subscribe(data => {
     // Handle secure data
   });
   ```

   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:
   - Protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by properly sanitizing user input and using Angular's built-in sanitization mechanisms, such as the `DomSanitizer` service or the `SafeHtml` pipe, to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

   ```typescript
   import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

   // ...

   constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

   sanitizeHTML(html: string): SafeHtml {
     return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(html);
   }
   ```

   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:
   - Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by including anti-CSRF tokens in your forms and validating them on the server-side.

   ```html
   <form action="/api/update-profile" method="post">
     <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="...">
     <!-- Other form fields -->
     <button type="submit">Update Profile</button>
   </form>
   ```

   SQL Injection and Code Injection Prevention:
   - Validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and other forms of code injection attacks. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.

   ```typescript
   import { HttpClient, HttpParams } from '@angular/common/http';

   // ...

   const username = userInput;
   const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?`;
   const params = new HttpParams().set('username', username);
   this.http.get('/api/users', { params }).subscribe(users => {
     // Handle user data
   });
   ```

   Data Encryption and Secure Storage:
   - Protect sensitive data by ensuring it is properly encrypted both in transit and at rest. Use HTTPS for secure communication between the client and the server and follow best practices for secure storage and handling of sensitive information.

   ```typescript
   // Example of sending encrypted data over HTTPS
   import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

   // ...

   const encryptedData = encryptData(data);
   this.http.post('/api/secure-endpoint', encryptedData, { headers }).subscribe(response => {
     // Handle response
   });
   ```

   Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:
   - Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in your application.

   Secure Coding Practices:
   - Follow secure coding practices, such as avoiding the use of `eval`, practicing proper input validation, and applying the principle of least privilege when granting permissions and access rights.

   By incorporating these security measures and following secure coding practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your Angular application.
