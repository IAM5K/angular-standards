2. Naming Conventions:
   - Consistent and meaningful names for components, services, variables, and functions improve code readability and maintainability.

   - Use PascalCase for class names. For example:

     ```typescript
     export class AppComponent { }
     export class UserService { }
     ```

   - Use camelCase for variable and function names. For example:

     ```typescript
     let isLoggedIn: boolean = false;
     function getUserData(): any { }
     ```

   - Prefix component files with a consistent prefix, such as `app-`, to avoid naming conflicts and easily identify Angular components. For example:

     ```typescript
     // Component file: app-header.component.ts
     import { Component } from '@angular/core';

     @Component({
       selector: 'app-header',
       // ...
     })
     export class HeaderComponent { }
     ```

     The selector for the component is `app-header` in kebab-case. This convention is important when using the component in templates.

   Following consistent naming conventions enhances code clarity and makes it easier for other developers to understand and work with your code.
