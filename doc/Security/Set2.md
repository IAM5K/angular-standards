The "require-trusted-types-for 'script'" directive in the Content-Security-Policy header ensures that trusted types are required for the execution of script elements, helping prevent script injection attacks.

18. How does the AOT template compiler in Angular help prevent template injection vulnerabilities?
The AOT (Ahead-of-Time) template compiler in Angular precompiles templates during the build process, which eliminates the risk of template injection vulnerabilities by ensuring that only the compiled and validated templates are used at runtime.

19. Why is dynamically generating and compiling templates with user data considered a security anti-pattern?
Dynamically generating and compiling templates with user data is considered a security anti-pattern because it bypasses Angular's built-in protections. It allows for the injection of untrusted code into the application, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

20. How does Angular's DomSanitizer help mitigate server-side XSS vulnerabilities?
Angular's DomSanitizer helps mitigate server-side XSS vulnerabilities by sanitizing and validating user input, ensuring that it is safe to use in the application. It helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts and protects against XSS attacks.

21. What is the default compiler used by Angular CLI applications, and why is it recommended for production deployments?
The default compiler used by Angular CLI applications is the AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiler. It is recommended for production deployments because it improves performance by precompiling templates, reduces the bundle size, and eliminates the need for template compilation at runtime.

22. How does the AOT (Ahead-of-Time) template compiler prevent template injection vulnerabilities and improve application performance?
The AOT template compiler prevents template injection vulnerabilities by precompiling templates during the build process. It ensures that only validated and compiled templates are used, eliminating the risk of injection attacks. Additionally, it improves application performance by reducing the size of the application bundle and removing the need for template compilation at runtime.

23. Why is it important to use a templating language that automatically escapes values to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server side?
Using a templating language that automatically escapes values is important on the server side to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Automatic escaping ensures that any user input included in the templates is properly sanitized, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.

24. What are the risks associated with creating Angular templates on the server side using a templating language?
Creating Angular templates on the server side using a templating language carries a high risk of introducing template-injection vulnerabilities. If user data is directly injected into the templates without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS attacks.

25. How does Angular's DomSanitizer help protect against XSS attacks?
Angular's DomSanitizer provides a set of methods that allow developers to safely sanitize and manipulate DOM elements. It helps protect against XSS attacks by sanitizing user input and ensuring that it is safe to use in the application, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.
