1. What is Cross-site script inclusion (XSSI)?
   - Cross-site script inclusion, also known as JSON vulnerability, allows an attacker's website to read data from a JSON API.
   - It works on older browsers by overriding built-in JavaScript object constructors and including an API URL using a `<script>` tag.

2. How does the Cross-site script inclusion attack work on older browsers?
   - The attack works by injecting a `<script>` tag that points to the API URL and overrides JavaScript object constructors.
   - If the returned JSON is executable as JavaScript, the attacker can read the data from the API.

3. How can servers prevent Cross-site script inclusion attacks in JSON responses?
   - Servers can prevent the attack by prefixing all JSON responses with a specific string to make them non-executable.
   - The convention is to use the string `")]}',\n"` at the beginning of JSON responses.

4. What is the convention used to make JSON responses non-executable?
   - The convention is to prefix JSON responses with the string `")]}',\n"` to make them non-executable.
   - This prefix ensures that the response cannot be executed as JavaScript code.

5. How does Angular's HttpClient library handle Cross-site script inclusion prevention?
   - Angular's HttpClient library recognizes the convention used to make JSON responses non-executable.
   - It automatically strips the string `")]}',\n"` from all responses before further parsing.
   - This helps prevent the execution of potentially malicious code from JSON responses.

6. Why is it important to audit Angular applications for security?
   - To identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities and ensure the application follows best practices.

7. What security principles should Angular applications follow?
   - Secure coding practices, input validation, authentication and authorization, secure communication, and proper error handling.

8. Which Angular-specific APIs should be audited in a security review?
   - APIs such as bypassSecurityTrustHtml, bypassSecurityTrustScript, bypassSecurityTrustStyle, and bypassSecurityTrustUrl.

9. How are security-sensitive APIs marked in the Angular documentation?
   - They are marked as security sensitive or indicated with specific security warnings and guidelines.

10. Can you provide examples of Angular APIs that should be audited for security?
    - asdasd
    - Examples include DomSanitizer's bypassSecurityTrustHtml, bypassSecurityTrustScript, and bypassSecurityTrustUrl methods.

11. What is cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF)?
    - It's an attack where an attacker tricks a user into performing unwanted actions on a different website.

12. How does a CSRF attack occur?
    - An attacker lures a user to a malicious website that makes requests to a target website using the user's credentials.

13. What is the purpose of XSRF protection in an application?
    - XSRF protection ensures that requests originate from the actual application, preventing unauthorized actions.

14. How can an application prevent CSRF attacks?
    - By implementing measures like generating and validating unique tokens, checking request headers, and enforcing same-origin policy.

15. What is the role of the client-side and server-side in mitigating CSRF attacks?
    - The client-side adds tokens to requests, while the server-side verifies those tokens to ensure request authenticity.

16. What is the common anti-XSRF technique used to prevent CSRF attacks?
    - It involves the use of randomly created authentication tokens sent as cookies and added as custom headers in subsequent requests.

17. How does the anti-XSRF technique make use of authentication tokens and custom request headers?
    - The server generates an authentication token, which the client includes in custom headers with subsequent requests for verification.

18. What is the advantage of using authentication tokens and custom headers in CSRF prevention?
    - They provide an additional layer of security by ensuring that only requests with valid tokens are accepted by the server.

19. How does Angular's HttpClient assist in mitigating CSRF attacks?
    - Angular's HttpClient supports adding custom headers to requests, making it easier to include the authentication token.

20. Where can you find more information about CSRF and its prevention techniques?
    - Resources such as the OWASP website and the Stanford University paper on Cross-Site Request Forgery provide detailed information.

21. What is cross-site script inclusion (XSSI)?
    - XSSI allows an attacker's website to read data from a JSON API by including the API URL using a `<script>` tag.

22. How does cross-site script inclusion (XSSI) work?
    - By overriding JavaScript object constructors and including an API URL using a `<script> `tag, the attacker can read data from the API.
  
23. How can Angular help prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF)?
    - Angular provides built-in support for handling XSRF protection, making it easier to implement on the client-side.

24. What is the purpose of the authentication token in CSRF prevention?
    - The authentication token helps verify the authenticity of requests and distinguishes them from forged requests.

25. What role does the same origin policy play in CSRF prevention?
    - The same origin policy ensures that only code from the same origin as the website can read cookies and set custom headers.

26. How does Angular's HttpClient support the client-side part of CSRF prevention?
    - Angular's HttpClient allows adding custom request headers, enabling the inclusion of the authentication token for CSRF prevention.

27. What are some external resources or references for learning more about CSRF and its prevention?
    - The OWASP website and the Stanford University paper on Cross-Site Request Forgery are valuable sources of information.

28. What is the significance of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) in relation to CSRF prevention?
    - OWASP provides guidance, best practices, and resources for web application security, including CSRF prevention techniques.

29. How can the use of authentication tokens and custom request headers enhance security in an Angular application?
    - They add an extra layer of security by ensuring requests originate from the legitimate application and not from malicious sources.

30. What is the importance of server-side implementation in mitigating CSRF attacks?
    - Server-side implementation is crucial to verify and validate requests, ensuring that only legitimate requests are processed.

31. What is the AOT template compiler in Angular?
    - The AOT (Ahead-of-Time) template compiler compiles Angular templates during the build process, before the application is deployed.

32. What vulnerabilities does the AOT template compiler prevent?
    - The AOT template compiler prevents a class of vulnerabilities called template injection.

33. What are the benefits of using the AOT template compiler?
    - Using the AOT template compiler improves application performance and enhances security by mitigating template injection vulnerabilities.

34. What is the default compiler used by Angular CLI applications?
    - The default compiler used by Angular CLI applications is the AOT template compiler.
