**Security Fundamentals:**

1. Angular provides built-in protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing user input and dynamically creating templates.
2. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is an attack where an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on a web application.
3. Angular provides helpers like XSRF tokens to mitigate CSRF attacks by ensuring that requests originate from the same application.
4. Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security mechanism that allows you to restrict the types of content that can be loaded on a web page.
5. CSP headers can be configured to restrict the sources of scripts, stylesheets, images, and other resources in an Angular application.

It helps mitigate server-side XSS vulnerabilities by ensuring that any user-generated or dynamically generated content is properly sanitized before being rendered in the application. DomSanitizer helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts or other HTML-based attacks by escaping or removing potentially dangerous elements or attributes.

75. Why is it important to use a templating language that automatically escapes values to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server side?
    Using a templating language that automatically escapes values is important to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server side. When values are automatically escaped, any special characters or HTML tags within the content are encoded or sanitized, ensuring that they are treated as plain text and not interpreted as executable code. This helps prevent the injection of malicious scripts or HTML tags that could compromise the security of the application or its users.

76. What are the risks associated with creating Angular templates on the server side using a templating language?
    Creating Angular templates on the server side using a templating language carries the risk of introducing template-injection vulnerabilities. If the server-side templates are not properly managed and sanitized, it becomes possible for an attacker to inject malicious code or modify the intended behavior of the template. This can lead to XSS attacks or other security breaches. It is important to follow best practices and ensure that server-side templates are generated and handled securely.

77. What is the purpose of Trusted Types in Angular applications?
    Trusted Types in Angular applications serve the purpose of enhancing security by preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. They enforce safer coding practices and simplify the auditing of application code by mitigating the risk of injecting malicious code into the application's templates.

78. How can Trusted Types help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks?
    Trusted Types help prevent XSS attacks by enforcing stricter policies and coding practices. They provide a way to control and restrict the types of values that can be used in certain contexts, such as HTML templates, thereby reducing the risk of executing untrusted or malicious code.

79. What is the browser support status for Trusted Types?
    The browser support for Trusted Types may vary depending on the specific browser being used. It is recommended to check the current browser support at caniuse.com/trusted-types to determine whether Trusted Types are supported in the targeted browsers for an Angular application.

80. What are the different Angular policies that can be used to enforce Trusted Types?
    The different Angular policies that can be used to enforce Trusted Types are:
    - "angular": This policy is used in security-reviewed code internal to Angular and is required for Angular to function when Trusted Types are enforced.
    - "angular#unsafe-bypass": This policy is used for applications that use any of Angular's DomSanitizer methods that bypass security, such as bypassSecurityTrustHtml.
    - "angular#unsafe-jit": This policy is used by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and should be enabled if the application interacts directly with the JIT compiler or is running in JIT mode using the platform browser dynamic.
    - "angular#bundler": This policy is used by the Angular CLI bundler when creating lazy chunk files.

Next category: "Configuring HTTP Headers for Trusted Types":

81. How can you configure HTTP headers for Trusted Types in your Angular application?
    You can configure HTTP headers for Trusted Types in your Angular application by setting the appropriate Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers on your server. These headers specify the policies related to Trusted Types, such as the allowed policies and requirements for script execution.

82. Where should you configure the HTTP headers for Trusted Types in production serving infrastructure?
    In production serving infrastructure, you should configure the HTTP headers for Trusted Types at the server level. This typically involves modifying the server configuration or using server-specific directives to set the Content-Security-Policy headers with the appropriate Trusted Types policies.

83. How can you configure HTTP headers for Trusted Types during local development and end-to-end testing using Angular CLI?
    During local development and end-to-end testing using Angular CLI, you can configure HTTP headers for Trusted Types by modifying the `angular.json` file. Specifically, you can use the `headers` property in the `serve` section of the configuration to set the desired Content-Security-Policy headers.

84. How can you configure HTTP headers for Trusted Types during unit testing using Karma?
    During unit testing using Karma, you can configure HTTP headers for Trusted Types by modifying the `karma.config.js` file. In the configuration file, you can use the `customHeaders` property to specify the Content-Security-Policy headers with the appropriate Trusted Types policies.

85. Can you provide an example of a Content-Security-Policy header specifically configured for Trusted Types and Angular?
    Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types angular; require-trusted-types-for 'script';

Next category: "Examples of Content-Security-Policy Headers for Trusted Types and Angular":

86. Can you provide an example of a Content-Security-Policy header specifically configured for Trusted Types and Angular applications that use methods in DomSanitizer that bypass security?
    Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types angular angular#unsafe-bypass; require-trusted-types-for 'script';

87. Can you provide an example of a Content-Security-Policy header specifically configured for Trusted Types and Angular applications using JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation?
    Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types angular angular#unsafe-jit; require-trusted-types-for 'script';

88. Can you provide an example of a Content-Security-Policy header specifically configured for Trusted Types and Angular applications that use lazy loading of modules?
    Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types angular angular#bundler; require-trusted-types-for 'script';

89. What is the significance of the "require-trusted-types-for 'script'" directive in the Content-Security-Policy header?
    The "require-trusted-types-for 'script'" directive in the Content-Security-Policy header specifies that the browser should only execute script code from trusted sources. It ensures that any dynamically loaded or generated scripts adhere to the trusted types policy, helping prevent script injection attacks.
