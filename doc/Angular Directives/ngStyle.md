5. NgStyle:

   Introduction:
   - The NgStyle directive allows dynamic manipulation of HTML element styles by binding to an object or expression that defines the styles.
   - It enables you to conditionally apply inline styles to elements based on certain conditions in your Angular templates.

   Snippet:
   ```html
   <div [ngStyle]="{ 'property': value, 'property2': value2 }">
     <!-- Content with dynamically applied styles -->
   </div>
   ```

   Explanation:
   - The `ngStyle` directive is used as an attribute on an element to define the styles to be applied.
   - Inside the `[ngStyle]` attribute, you provide an object where the keys represent the style properties, and the values represent the values for those properties.
   - The values can be expressions or component properties.
   - When the expression evaluates to a valid value, the associated style property is applied to the element.
   - Multiple styles and conditions can be provided within the object.
   - The NgStyle directive allows for dynamic styling and provides flexibility for customizing the appearance of elements.

   Common Mistake:
   - A common mistake with `NgStyle` is not providing valid CSS property names or values. It's important to ensure that the property names and values are correct, properly formatted, and compatible with CSS syntax.
