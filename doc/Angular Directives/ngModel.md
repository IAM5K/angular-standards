6. NgModel:

   Introduction:
   - The NgModel directive provides two-way data binding between a form input element and a component property, enabling easy handling of user input.
   - It is commonly used for capturing and updating user input in Angular forms.

   Snippet:
   ```html
   <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="property">
   ```

   Explanation:
   - The `ngModel` directive is used as a two-way binding syntax within an input element to bind the value of the input to a component property.
   - It establishes a synchronization between the input value and the component property, allowing changes in one to reflect in the other.
   - When the user interacts with the input element, the component property is updated, and vice versa.
   - The NgModel directive simplifies the process of capturing user input and keeping it in sync with the component's state.

   Common Mistake:
   - A common mistake with `NgModel` is forgetting to import the `FormsModule` from `@angular/forms` in the respective module file. Without importing this module, the NgModel directive won't work, and an error will occur.
